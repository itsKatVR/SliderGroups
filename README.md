# Slider Groups

- Editor Workflow

Create empty parents: Group_1, Group_2, Group_3, …

Put the objects for each group under its parent

Drag those parents into groupRoots (you can add as many as you want)

Set slider Whole Numbers ON (script also forces it if autoSetSliderMax is true)

Hook slider OnValueChanged → OnSliderChanged
